# hs_nyc

This application attempts to demonstrate separation of concerns and state management for dealing with multiple endpoints of data. The app is written in Flutter and is currently available for Android and will be available for iOS soon. The Scoped_Model State management library is used and the entire application is approximately 1000 lines of Dart code including comments.

•	Network Permissions are enabled with conditional UI for non-connected status when opened</br>
• Google Maps client opens and drops a pin at the school’s location when the address is tapped</br>
•	Email client opens and the school’s email populates the “To:” line when the email is tapped</br>
•	Phone opens and the school’s number populates the call line when the phone number is tapped</br>
•	Webview opens and is directed to the school’s website when the website is tapped</br>
